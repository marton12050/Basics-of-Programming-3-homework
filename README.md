Standard Tetris game, where shapes come down one by one on a 20x10 grid, and while they are coming down, they can be moved left or right. In addition, the shapes can be rotated so that they fall into the correct position on the base. If a complete row is filled with shapes, the row disappears, the player earns points, and the shapes above it fall down. New shapes continue to appear until the fallen shapes reach the top of the grid, at which point the game ends. The goal is to earn as many points as possible.

User-case

* During the game, the active shape can be moved left or right using the left and right arrows.
* The up arrow rotates the active shape.
* The down arrow makes the active shape fall faster.
* Pressing Space pauses or resumes the game.

When the program is launched, the tutorial window appears, explaining how to play the game and what the objective is. After that, the player can choose to play Tetris or view the leaderboard, which displays the top 10 players' names and scores. At the end of the game, the player can enter their name to appear on the leaderboard if they have earned enough points. At any time, the player can choose from the options in the menu, which include the home page, tutorial, Tetris, and leaderboard options.
